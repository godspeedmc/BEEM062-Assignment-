# Blockchain and Financial Technologies Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project covering various topics in blockchain, financial technologies, and data analysis. Below is an overview of each task.

## 1. Wallet Webpage

### 1.1 Wallet

The wallet webpage generates a private key, displays an associated address and QR code. Additionally, it includes the following features:

- **Balance:** Shows the balance associated with the address.
- **Mnemonics:** Displays the mnemonics for the generated private key.

### 1.2 Financial Literacy Game

A webpage with an interactive financial literacy game. The game teaches users about a specific financial concept through puzzles. Users are required to solve randomly generated puzzles, and their scores indicate whether they answered correctly or not.

## 2. Time Series and Gradient Descent in Python and NumPy

A Jupyter notebook in Python is provided to extract a single time series from either the Quandl API or CryptoCompare API. The notebook uses NumPy to find Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of α and β in a linear regression model. The estimates are obtained both analytically and through trial and error using a Gradient Descent algorithm.

### Additional Information

- **Gradient Descent Variation:** Describes one other variation of Gradient Descent and explains why it is used.
- **Challenges in Convergence:** Discusses why convergence to a Loss Function minimum may be difficult in practice and potential solutions.

## 3. AI and the Blockchain

### 3.1 Bitcoin Turing Completeness

Explores whether Bitcoin is Turing complete, referencing Ian Grigg's paper and contrasting views in mainstream literature.

### 3.2 ChatGPT Discussion Question

Evaluates a discussion question about ChatGPT, comparing it to traditional chatbots and discussing the benefits and drawbacks of using a large language model like ChatGPT for conversational AI.

### 3.3 Blockchain and Systemic Problems from AI

Analyzes the potential of blockchain technology in solving systemic problems arising from AI, referencing Ian Grigg's paper and other relevant sources.

## 4. Time Series Forecasting

A Python notebook for time series forecasting of a chosen financial time series. The analysis includes a rationale for selecting the series, identification of influencing factors, and a machine learning approach (e.g., L1/L2 Regularization) to build a predictive model.

### Additional Information

- **Data Extraction:** Describes the challenges in extracting the relevant time series.
- **Model Reduction:** Discusses reducing a larger model to a smaller one using machine learning techniques and evaluates the effectiveness of the implementation.
